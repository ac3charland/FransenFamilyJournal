# FransenFamilyJournal

For years, my extended family would stay in touch by writing yearly journal entries and sending them to the family via email; we called it the Fransen Family Journal. I decided it was time to bring that tradition into the 21st century and build a blog-style website for the journal.

## Usage
Users create text posts, upload images, and submit their entries for display on the journal's main page. Other users can then preview and read those entries. 

## Technologies Used
The Fransen Family Journal is a full-stack application that utilizes several technologies:
* A MongoDB database
* Passport.js user authentication
* A server powered by Express.js 
* Backend powered by Node.js
* An internal RESTful API
* jQuery frontend rendering
* Bootstrap frontend styling
